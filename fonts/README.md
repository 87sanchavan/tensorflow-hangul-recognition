## Fonts Directory

In this directory, you should place several different font files that support Korean text.
The font file types should be .ttf (True Type Font). The hangul-image-generator.py script
will use the fonts in this directory to generate several Hangul images to be used in
training the TensorFlow model.

#### Getting Font Files

A good resource for getting Korean fonts can be found on the
[Naver website](http://software.naver.com/software/fontList.nhn?categoryId=I0000000).

To download fonts on this website, just click on the font you would like, then
keep clicking the big blue download buttons until a ttf file is actually downloaded.
